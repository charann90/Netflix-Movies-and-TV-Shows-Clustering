# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Clustering


Many movie streaming platforms struggle to provide personalized movie recommendations to their users. Existing recommendation systems often rely on basic features like genre or user ratings, which may not capture the nuanced preferences of individual users. The existing movie recommendation systems lack the ability to effectively leverage text-based features to identify and recommend similar movies. While some systems consider basic metadata such as movie titles, cast, or plot summaries, they fail to extract meaningful insights from these features to cluster similar movies together.

To address the aforementioned gap, I designed and developed a movie recommendation system that leverages text-based features to provide personalized and accurate movie recommendations.
